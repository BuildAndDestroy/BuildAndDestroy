# 👋 Hey there, I'm Mitch O'Donnell

🚨 Offensive Security Engineer | 🛡️ Product & Application Security | ☁️ Cloud Security Specialist  
📍 Based in the U.S. | 🧠 Think Red, Act Strategic | 🧰 Golang + Python + Kubernetes + AWS

Welcome to my GitHub! I work at the intersection of offensive security and product resilience—where breaking things makes the product better. My experience spans vulnerability research, Red Team operations, AppSec, Cloud Security, and PSIRT advisory.

I design and execute adversary simulations, develop custom malware and C2 infrastructure, and deliver technical risk insights that guide product teams and engineering leadership. My work often involves:

- 🔬 Building custom payloads in **Go**, **Python**, **PowerShell**, and **C++**
- ☁️ Running ops in **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Kubernetes**
- 📦 Containerizing exploits and automation with **Docker**
- 🛠️ Automating reporting with **Ghostwriter**, **Vectr**, and internal tooling
- 📊 Contributing to PSIRT and threat modeling workflows

You’ll find a mix of PoCs, tools, and research on here - some personal, some from past or sanitized work projects.
